  <h2>Course Description</h2>

<div class="row">
  <div class="span12">
  <p><strong>CSCI-C 343 Data Structures (4 cr.)</strong> P: CSCI-C 212. CSCI-C 241. C: CSCI-C 241. N & M Systematic study of data structures encountered in computing problems, structure and use of storage media, methods of representing structured data, and techniques for operating on data structures. Lecture and laboratory. Credit given for only one of CSCI-C 343 or H 343. </p>

  <h3>Course Outcomes</h3>
  <p>At the end of this course you will have acquired a firm knowledge of data structures and practical experience implementing them in a software development environment using industry-leading tools and collaborative practices. Additionally, you will be done with the core Computer Science curriculum.<br /><big><strong><em>Pretty awesome.</em></strong></big></p>

  <h3>Analysis Skills</h3>
  <p>Assignments will be made to cover the analysis of runtime and memory efficiency for each data structure. These are to be completed <em>individually</em> (that is, not as a group), and will be turned in during Wednesday lecture, when assigned. An analysis assignment and a programming assignment will never be due in the same week, although multiple assignments may be released at the same time.</p>

  <h3>Project</h3>
  <p>To understand the data structures taught in this course, students will implement a library-based media player in Java using the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/gstreamer-java/">gstreamer library</a>. This will illustrate the principles taught in lecture. This project will foster group collaboration skills, vital to success as a computer scientist working in industry and academia. Teams will be composed of 2-3 students enrolled in the same lab section, such that lab time can be used to help foster collaboration and give instructors an opportunity to observe group participation. The project is cumulative, and the final assignment will involve a creative extension of the media player, to be determined by each group and will be due during the week of December 3-7, graded during a live demo to course instructors.</p>
  
  <h4>GitHub:IU</h4>
  <p>Software development will use the <a href="http://www.git-scm.com/">Git Source Control Manager</a>, used by <a href="https://github.com/facebook">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://github.com/twitter">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://github.com/WindowsAzure">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://github.com/linkedin">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://github.com/mozilla">Mozilla</a>, <em><a href="http://git.kernel.org/">the entire Linux kernel</a></em> and <strong><em><a href="https://github.com/repositories">many, many more</a></em></strong>. We will use a private instance of the <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> software which uses your IU credentials, known as <a href="https://github.iu.edu/">GitHub:IU</a>. See the IU Knowledge Base article <a href="http://kb.iu.edu/data/bagk.html">What is Git and GitHub:FI, and how do I use them?</a> This is not optional, as assignments will be turned in via a git commit.</p>
  
  <h4>Tools</h4>
  <p><strong>TODO:</strong> Settle on a cannonical IDE, write config guide.</p>
  <p> It is recommended that students use the Eclipse/IntelliJ IDE with an appropriate Git plugin to help manage version control. It is recommended that development occur on the Computer Science Program's Burrow/Mine Linux Lab, located in Lindley Hall 004/035. Other IDEs and text editors may be used, but it is <em>highly recommended</em> students use the supported tools and systems above, especially for their debugging tools. It is the student's own perogative to install the development environment on their personal machine, using configuration instructions available on the course website.</p>
  
  <h4>Deadlines</h4>
  <p>Assignments will be turned in via a commit to <a href="http://github.iu.edu/">GitHub:IU</a> by 11:59pm on Wednesday evenings. This process will be explained during the first lab section. Important information for the next assignment will be given during lab sections on Thursday and Friday, to encourage an early start. New assignments will be released on Mondays.</p>

  <h2>Tests</h2>

<div class="row">
  <div class="span12">
  <p>The course will have two tests &mdash; a midterm and a final &mdash;  primarily over the analysis portions of the course, along with some understanding of the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/gstreamer-java/">gstreamer API</a>.</p>
  <p><strong>The final will be <big>Friday, December 14 from 5-7pm</big>. It is in the syllabus 4 months in advance. Do not leave Bloomington before taking your final.</strong></p>
