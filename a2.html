					Analyze the performance for the best, average and worst case scenarios when you delete an element from a growable array. Consider the 2 possibilities below when doing this analysis. 
					<pre>
/** 
  * Removes the element found at the specified index-th position by replacing it with a <code>null</code> value.
  * @param index     The index in the array of the element to be removed.
  * @return          The object that was deleted.  
  */
Object removeAt(int index);

/** 
  * Removes the element found at the specified index-th position by shifting all elements that come after it to the "left". 
  * That is, if we are removing the 2nd element, the 3rd element becomes the 2nd, the 4th element becomes the 3rd and so on. 
  * Finally, the size of the array is decreased, so we know that next time we add, we can overwrite what was the last element 
  * of the array.
  *
  * @param index     The index in the array of the element to be removed.
  * @return          The object that was removed. <code>null</code> if the the specified index does not exist in the array.

			<div class="span12">
				<p>
					Even though the first version of removeAt is more efficient, Java implements the second version. Discuss what the drawbacks of the first version of removeAt are, why it is difficult to work with, and not suitable as being the standard implementation in a language.

			<h2>Problem 3</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="span12">
				<p>The <code>add(Object item)</code> method in an ArrayList needs to keep track of the underlying array and when it gets full, it replaces it with a new, bigger array in which all elements from the old array are copied. On the first day of classes, we discussed two algorithms to determine the size of the new array. In the first, the new array is 1 larger than the old array (an N element array is replaced by an (N+1) element array). In the second algorithm, the new array is twice larger than the old array (an N element array is replaced by an 2N element array). What is the time complexity of <code>add(Object item)</code> when using the first array expansion method (replacing with an N+1 element array)? Describe in detail how you arrived at your answer.</p>
				<p><strong>Bonus: </strong>Do the same for the second version of the expansion algorithm (replacing the underlying array with an 2N-element array). Which method is better? Since this is a more difficult analysis this bonus question is not required. We will discuss the analysis in the discussion section.</p>

			<div class="span12">
				<p>Create a c343homework repo on IU GitHub (let's only use c343player for your programming project). Create a ta1 folder under it and add a file with your solution in it. The file should be typeset (i.e. use something like Word, LaTeX, etc.). Make sure the course instructors have been added as collaborators to your repo: <code>jammurdo</code>, <code>dnikolov</code>, and <code>sjeganat</code>.</p>
				<p>If the problems with IU GitHub are not resolved at the time you need to submit the assignment, we'll create an OnCourse dropbox and update this assignment with addtional instructions.</p>
